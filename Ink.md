# Ink Protocol
The Ink protocol (Ink) is a decentralized reputation payment system specifically designed for trustless peer to peer transactions in online marketplaces. In other words, Ink is a payment system where a buyer and a seller can safely complete an online transaction without a third party intervening. However, before delving into the specifics, it is important to understand Ink’s origins.

Ink was developed by Listia, a California based company that provides an online marketplace for trading used goods. Ever since its launch in 2009, the company has raised over $11 million in funds from some of the largest names in venture capital. Today, nine years later, the Listia marketplace has around 10 million users who have made a staggering 100 million trades. Listia has been using its own centralized virtual currency, Listia Credits, to supplement these transactions over the years. Users earn and spend these credits by selling and purchasing goods within the marketplace. However, the Listia credits system poses certain difficulties that make it less optimal. First of all, it is centralized. That means Listia has to monitor and approve every transaction. Second, these credits cannot be exchanged into USD. Naturally, this means that users could only spend their credits within the Listia market environment. Finally, sellers could not take the reputation they built on the Listia platform and bring it to other markets such as eBay. 

In an attempt to tackle these challenges, the Listia team has developed Ink. Ink will be fully decentralized. That means Listia will no longer be behind every transaction. Second, users will have the opportunity to transfer Ink tokens (XNK) into USD and vice versa. Third, given its decentralized nature, Ink is a system that can be used on any platform. Sellers will have the opportunity to take the reputation they build in one marketplace and bring it to another. Ink is powered by an ERC20 computable token (XNK). Simply put, this means that Ink wallets will be easy to use and compatible with the Ethereum network. At the same time XNK will maintain many positive qualities. It will be:
* fungibile  (every XNK unit will be worth the same amount in USD)
* limited in supply
* Fractionally divisible
* and have low transaction costs (due to its decentralized nature)

Additionally, it was briefly alluded to that Ink is built on the Ethereum platform. In other words, ink inherits many of the advantages ethereum can offer such as smart contracts. Smart contracts are essentially independent escrows that are not held by anyone. These escrows can only be opened under certain conditions which are specified before they are sealed. 

Smart contracts are the backbone of Ink. They allow sellers and buyers to come to an agreement on their own. In the case where there is a dispute and no resolution can be agreed upon, Ink provides an opportunity for a third party intervention in the form of a mediator. The mediator comes in and makes a decision regarding the transaction in question. The decision made is final and cannot be revoked. Mediators are usually set in the beginning of a transaction. They can be optional, but not always. This depends on the marketplace a given transaction is taking place on. Some platforms will chose to act as third party mediators in order to provide an extra branch of security. Listia is one of them. Ink was developed this way because most marketplaces are not built for decentralized transactions; thus, each online market environment should have the opportunity to integrate Ink in a way that best fits its platform. However, on platforms where there is no central governing force such as Facebook or craigslist, users will either chose a third party to mediate a transaction or go on without one.

All Ink transactions are broken down into states. This way it is easy to carry out and manage each transaction from a technological and a logistical perspective. First, a buyer initiates a transaction. This initiation entails several specifications.
* Who the seller is, which is represented by the sellers Ethereum wallet address
* The price of the item being purchased in XNK tokens
* The mediator (if used) 
* policy guidelines on how the transaction will be dealt with
* Transaction metadata, which is essentially the information needed to find the transaction on the open ledger

The initiation phase culminates with the buyer’s funds placed in an escrow smart contract. 

Second, the seller has to either approve the transaction or ignore it. If the buyer and seller could not agree on the terms of the transaction, the seller will simply ignore the transaction and the buyer can revoke his/her tokens from the escrow contract. However, if an agreement was reached, the seller can accept and legitimize the transaction. At this point the seller can begin processing the purchase as his/her money is secured in the escrow. 

Third, the seller has to process the transaction and begin shipping in a timely manner as indicated by the policies set in the beginning. At this point there are several possibilities:
The seller refunds the escrow due to a problem with supplying the purchased item as dictated by the agreed upon policy conditions.
* The buyer disputes the purchase as it has not been delivered within the agreed upon time frame.
* The buyer disputes the purchase as the delivered item is not satisfactory.
* The item is delivered and the buyer is satisfied and confirms the transaction.
* The item is delivered and the buyer does not confirm or dispute the purchase. At this point the transaction is automatically confirmed and the escrow funds are open for the seller to collect.

Fourth, the transaction is confirmed or disputed. If the transaction is confirmed, it is over. However, if the buyer disputes the transaction then the seller has an opportunity to provide a response. At this point one of four things can happen: 
* An agreement is reached and the buyer ends up confirming the transaction.
* The seller refunds the escrow
* The buyer forces a refund on the seller after a certain amount of time has passed as indicated in the policy agreement as the escalation time.
* The seller escalates the disputed to a mediator to resolve the dispute.

Fifth, the mediator gets involved. A mediation time is allocated to the mediator in order to gather information and come up with a decision. At this point the transaction is on hold and the buyer and seller have no options. However, if the mediation time has ended, both parties have several options:
* The seller can refund the escrow 
* The buyer can confirm the purchase 
* The buyer and seller can split the escrow 50/50 
* The two parties can continue waiting for the mediator’s response.

Sixth, the transaction is mediated. The mediator makes a decision. In this case the mediator has three options:
* Refund the buyer
* Confirm the transaction
* Divide the escrow funds between the seller and the buyer according to their own discretion

If all of this seems to complicated, do not worry. In order to make Ink more accessible to the average person, Listia is developing an app that will allow anyone to reap the benefits of a decentralized market system. Through this app, users will be able to spend and receive USD without having to deal with XNK or ethereum at all. They will have the opportunity to use this app on any platform, taking their reputation with them. 

With these features in mind, hopefully ink can clear the cloudy path ahead as it relates to the future of online markets. A solid technology with a strong foundation behind it, ink should be primed for success.
